## Processing CommonMark using Folds

This is the code that accompanies Swift Talk Episode 152: [Processing CommonMark using Folds](https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E152-processing-commonmark-using-folds)

A simplified version of our [Swift wrapper around cmark](https://github.com/objcio/commonmark-swift/tree/swift-5) is inlined in this project, but you need to have cmark installed to run this project (`brew install cmark`).
